# TCGCLI 

A really crude tool for building Pok√©mon TCG Pocket decks, tracking battle outcomes, and generating battle statistics so I can improve my game. This script helps you manage your deck by letting you add cards from a list of valid TCG Pocket cards, manage copy limits, and record battle outcomes along with statistics. Pretty useful for my needs, but hey take what's useful and discard the rest <3
