# Sample SwiftUI shell (template)

These files show how to call the `tcgmobile.Manager` APIs generated by `gomobile bind`.
They are **not** a full Xcode project. Copy them into a new SwiftUI app and update the
module import if your framework is renamed.

## Notes
- The `TCGClient` assumes the framework module name is `tcgcli` (from `tcgcli.framework`).
- Update `decksDir` if you use a different application documents path.
- JSON decoding uses lightweight Swift models that mirror the Go payloads.
